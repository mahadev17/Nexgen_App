If your film will not arrive by the deadline due to a last minute issue, you can contact us so we can evaluate options.</string>
    <string name="ans3">you will get a email stating it has been received</string>
    <string name="ans4">2. Two (one digital copy and one dvd copy)</string>
    <string name="ans5">Yes. However, you must still send 2 copies one dvd and submit an online version through dropsend.com</string>
    <string name="ans6">Yes. However, we ask that new versions arrive no later than the                      Late Deadline. With the new submissions coming in, it is unlikely we will be able to properly evaluate a new cut and give the new films coming in all the consideration they deserve.</string>
    <string name="ans7">We consider a short anything 21 minutes or under. 
including credits anything over will be considered </string>
    <string name="ans8">We have no ratings limitations on films submitted. We program films with a variety content, from family friendly to work that would be more appropriate for mature audiences and would likely be rated R or higher NC17 will not accepted. Our mission is to program them together and if it should have a rating higher then PG-13 we will let viewers know before hand
        
    </string>
    <string name="ans9">No, The festival main purpose is to engage audience around the globe to participate in on the voting process and select films that are appealing to them.</string>
    <string name="ans10">No not at this moment. In the near future we will notify all filmmakers</string>
    <string name="ans11">100 will be announced initially from a pool of submission we will receive. We then will narrow it down to the top 50, From the top 50 We then will select the top 25. Only 16 will be chosen and will compete in each section. We will announce the winner for best film overall according to the audience participation based on how you promote and share you film during the festival run. Our Festival also encourage filmmakers to share their film as much as they can so the more votes can determine a higher percentage for their film to be nominated for best film overall. We will also have awards available for the remaining participating films from the top 16 categories.</string>
    <string name="ans12">The winner for best film overall will win the grand prize from the films money jackpot along with the Audience choice award for best film. The remaining 15 films with the highest scores will determine the appropriate awards for the film for best story, best acting, and best cinematography along with best actor and best actress.  </string>
    <string name="ans13">We program thematically. Excluding a few shorts programs every year, we do not choose the themes ahead of time. We look to see what themes we can build from the submissions received.</string>
    <string name="ans14">No, at this time we only cater to american films</string>
    <string name="ans15">No. We prefer great and interesting stories.</string>
    <string name="ans16">This one is hard to answer, but yes. However, we recommend doing so only if the version being submitted is a radically different cut or if the previous submission was a work in progress with lots to be done. We also program thematically so a short that may have not fit the blocks of one year, may be appropriate for the next year. BUT, full disclosure, it’s been rare a resubmitted film has been accepted the next year. If you do resubmit, please note that the film is a resubmission and what changes were made between the different cuts.</string>
    <string name="ans17">If it’s not your film, it’s advisable to submit only after you’ve received permission from the filmmakers.</string>
    <string name="ans18">We use 10 to 20 screeners from the community to watch films. Some are filmmakers, and some are film buffs who have a passion for film.</string>
    <string name="ans19">Only if they are not above the line (director, screenwriter, actor, producer, casting director, etc.) and didn’t play a major role in helping produce, or raised funds for the film being submitted. They must also alert NMFF when a film they worked on has or will be submitted and what their role was. If a film is submitted after a screener has joined our committee, they may be asked to step down depending on their level of participation on the project. The conflict of interest and appearance of conflict of interest are too great to allow filmmakers to submit and be screeners.


	
	
	Each film is watched by at least 2 screeners and films are scored using five criteria: Story, Technical, Originality, Acting/Subjects and Entertainment on a scale of 1 to 10. The scores are averaged per screener.
	The scores are used to help narrow down the large number of submissions to create a pool of films to make final selections from. The final pool varies year to year, but it’s roughly a third to a quarter of all submitted films that make it to the last round.</string>
    <string name="ans20">No. When it comes to final selections, films are selected based on the overall filmmaking, variety and what will make the strongest and most interesting lineup. When it comes to selecting films, it’s a film’s content and quality that matter, not it’s score.</string>
    <string name="ans21">Due to the number of submissions received and technical limitations, it’s not possible for us to share scores at this time. It is something we continue to explore every year and hope to one day make available to all filmmakers.</string>
    <string name="ans22">We ask that you do not email or call us to find out updates. We’re a year round arts organization, as well as overseeing the 2000 plus submissions we receive for the festival. It’s not that we don’t want to give updates, it’s just nearly impossible to answer those questions in a timely manner.</string>
    <string name="ans23">The Final 16 selections are made by the Director of Programming.</string>
